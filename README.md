## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to analyze sleep efficiency data to understand the factors that may influence sleep quality. The research question revolves around identifying the relationship between various features (such as age, gender, sleep duration, etc.) and sleep efficiency. The primary goal is to build predictive models that can estimate sleep efficiency based on these features.
## Methods
Tools:
For data analysis and inference, the project utilizes a set of powerful tools:
NumPy
SciPy
Pandas 
Scikit-learn
Additional Tools/Modules Used :
Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization, specifically for creating histograms, correlation matrices, and pair plots in your code.
XGBoost: The code imports XGBClassifier and XGBRegressor from the XGBoost library, indicating the use of XGBoost for classification and regression tasks.
